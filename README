This repository contains tools used to achieve our master's thesis at Ecole Polytechnique de Louvain (Universit√© Catholique de Louvain) for the academic year 2017-2018.

\CBGP\ folder contains python scripts to run a BGP solver called C-BGP

\simulator\ folder contains a java program simulating the behavior of CRP, our protocol for intradomain exchanges of interdomain routing information.

Infos about these two tools can be found in their own README.
